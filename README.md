SIEM Internship - Phase 2: Suspicious Activity Detection & Threat Simulation
This repository contains the simulated attack scenarios, log collection, and detection evidence for Phase 2 of the SIEM Internship Program. All tasks were executed with a focus on log generation and validation for common suspicious activities and attacker behaviors.

ðŸ”§ Lab Environment
Windows 10 Home VM - Victim/Target system(10.0.2.4)

Kali Linux VM - Attacker system and log collector(10.0.2.15)

Network - NAT setup with working communication between VMs

Log Collection - Syslog-ng, Event Viewer, Sysmon used for capturing logs

âœ… Completed Scenarios & Proofs
1. Privilege Escalation
Note: A new user account was created and manually added to the local Administrators group. This simulates privilege escalation and triggers Event ID 4728, showing group membership changes.

2. Lateral Movement (PsExec)
Note: Used Sysinternals PsExec tool to execute a command remotely, mimicking attacker lateral movement behavior over the network.

3. Suspicious File Download
Note: A suspicious ZIP archive was downloaded from a test web server, simulating file delivery by phishing or external threat actors.

4. Malicious PowerShell Execution
Note: Executed obfuscated PowerShell commands and scripts using encoded strings and suspicious flags. Logs were captured via Sysmon (Event ID 1) and Windows Event ID 4104 for script block logging.

5. Malicious Archive Execution
Note: A password-protected archive containing a .exe file was extracted and executed to simulate delivery and execution of malware from archive formats.

6. C2/Beaconing Simulation
Note: A scheduled task was created on the Windows machine to ping the attacker's Kali IP every 5 minutes, simulating Command & Control beaconing behavior in malware.

7. Web Activity & Vulnerability Scan Simulation
Note: Simulated browsing activity to unknown/malicious-looking websites and scanned the Windows machine using Nmap to trigger logs related to vulnerability probing.

8. Unauthorized RDP Login Simulation
Note: Enabled RDP on Windows 10 Home using RDPWrap, then performed a login attempt over RDP to simulate unauthorized remote access. Events like 4624 (Type 10) were observed.

9. Web Shell / Leak Simulation
Note: Simulated data exfiltration or reverse shell execution from the target system to the attacker using simple web-based or Netcat tools to show outbound connection behavior.
